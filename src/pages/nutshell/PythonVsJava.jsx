              <header className="section-header">Hello, World!</header>
              <p>The "Hello, World!" program is often the first program written when learning a new language. In Java, this involves creating a class and defining the main method, where you use `System.out.println` to print the string to the console. The syntax requires the use of curly braces and semicolons, which makes the structure more formal and verbose.</p>
              <code className="code">public class Main &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Hello, World!");<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#125;<br />&#125;</code>
              <p>In contrast, Python simplifies this process significantly. You can print "Hello, World!" with a single line of code using the `print` function. This simplicity and ease of use make Python more approachable for beginners.</p>
              <code className="code">print("Hello, World!")</code>

            <section className="main-section" id="Variables">
              <header className="section-header">Variables</header>
              <p>Variables in programming are used to store data values. Java is a statically typed language, meaning that you must declare the type of variable before using it. For example, to store the number 5, you would write `int number = 5;`. This explicit declaration helps catch errors at compile time and can make the code more predictable.</p>
              <code className="code">int number = 5;</code>
              <p>Python, on the other hand, is dynamically typed, so you do not need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. You can simply write `number = 5`, and Python will infer that it is an integer. This flexibility makes Python faster to write and easier to read, although it can sometimes lead to runtime errors that would be caught at compile time in Java.</p>
              <code className="code">number = 5</code>

            <section className="main-section" id="Data_Types">
              <header className="section-header">Data Types</header>
              <p>Both Java and Python support a variety of data types, though they handle them differently. In Java, data types are divided into primitive types (such as int, float, double, boolean, char) and objects. Primitive types are not objects and are therefore more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance. Examples of Java primitive types include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>int</li>
                <li>float</li>
                <li>double</li>
                <li>boolean</li>
                <li>char</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In Python, however, everything is treated as an object. This includes basic data types such as int, float, bool, and str, as well as more complex types like lists, tuples, and dictionaries. This object-oriented nature of Python provides greater flexibility and powerful built-in methods for data manipulation, although it may come at the cost of some performance compared to Java's primitive types.</p>
              <code className="code">int, float, bool, str, list, tuple, dict, etc.</code>

            <section className="main-section" id="If-Else_Statements">
              <header className="section-header">If-Else Statements</header>
              <p>Conditional statements allow a program to execute different code paths based on certain conditions. In Java, an if-else statement is enclosed in curly braces, and each condition must be followed by parentheses and a semicolon. For example, to check if a number is positive, you would write `if (x &gt; 0) &#123; System.out.println("Positive"); &#125; else &#123; System.out.println("Negative"); &#125;`. This structure is clear but requires more syntax elements.</p>
              <code className="code">if (x &gt; 0) &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Positive");<br />&#125; else &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Negative");<br />&#125;</code>
              <p>In Python, if-else statements rely on indentation to define the scope of each condition, which results in a more streamlined and readable syntax. You can check if a number is positive with the following code: `if x &gt; 0: print("Positive") else: print("Negative")`. This indentation-based approach reduces the need for additional characters and makes the code easier to read at a glance.</p>
              <code className="code">if x &gt; 0:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;print("Positive")<br />else:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;print("Negative")</code>
            </section>

            <section className="main-section" id="Loops">
              <header className="section-header">Loops</header>
              <p>Loops are fundamental in programming for iterating over a sequence of elements or executing a block of code multiple times. Java's for loop is more verbose, requiring explicit initialization, condition, and increment expressions within parentheses, followed by a block of code in curly braces. For example, `for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) &#123; System.out.println(i); &#125;` iterates from 0 to 4, printing each value.</p>
              <code className="code">for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(i);<br />&#125;</code>
              <p>Python's for loop is more concise and intuitive, using the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers. The equivalent loop in Python would be `for i in range(5): print(i)`, which achieves the same result with fewer lines of code and no need for explicit initialization or incrementing.</p>
              <code className="code">for i in range(5):<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;print(i)</code>
              <p>When it comes to while loops, Java again requires more syntax. A Java while loop, such as `int i = 0; while (i &lt; 5) &#123; System.out.println(i); i++; &#125;`, uses explicit condition checking and incrementing within the loop body. Python's while loop simplifies this to `i = 0 while i &lt; 5: print(i) i += 1`, maintaining readability and reducing the syntactic overhead.</p>
              <code className="code">int i = 0;<br />while (i &lt; 5) &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(i);<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;i++;<br />&#125;</code>
              <code className="code">i = 0<br />while i &lt; 5:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;print(i)<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;i += 1</code>

            <section className="main-section" id="Classes">
              <header className="section-header">Classes</header>
              <p>Both Java and Python support object-oriented programming through the use of classes. In Java, a class definition includes access modifiers (such as public or private), methods, and member variables. For example, a simple class definition might look like `public class Dog &#123; String breed; public void bark() &#123; System.out.println("Woof"); &#125; &#125;`. This structure enforces encapsulation and helps manage access to the class's methods and properties.</p>
              <code className="code">public class Dog &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;String breed;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;public void bark() &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Woof");<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#125;<br />&#125;</code>
              <p>In Python, classes are defined with the `class` keyword, and methods are defined with the `def` keyword. Python does not require explicit access modifiers, and indentation is used to define the scope of the class and its methods. For example, a similar class in Python would be `class Dog: def __init__(self, breed): self.breed = breed def bark(self): print("Woof")`. This approach is more concise and easier to read, although it may lack the strict access controls provided by Java.</p>
              <code className="code">class Dog:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;def __init__(self, breed):<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.breed = breed<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;def bark(self):<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Woof")</code>
            </section>

            <section className="main-section" id="Arrays">
              <header className="section-header">Arrays</header>
              <p>Arrays are fundamental data structures used to store collections of elements. In Java, arrays are declared with a specific size and type, such as `int[] numbers = new int[5];`. Once declared, elements can be accessed and modified using their indices, as in `numbers[0] = 1;`. This fixed-size nature of Java arrays can be limiting but also ensures memory efficiency.</p>
              <code className="code">int[] numbers = new int[5];<br />numbers[0] = 1;</code>
              <p>Python provides more flexibility with lists, which can dynamically grow or shrink in size. A list is created using square brackets, and elements can be added, removed, or accessed using built-in methods. For example, `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` creates a list, and `numbers.append(6)` adds a new element to it. This dynamic nature makes Python lists more versatile for various programming tasks.</p>
              <code className="code">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br />numbers.append(6)</code>

            <section className="main-section" id="Algorithms">
              <header className="section-header">Algorithms</header>
              <p>Implementing algorithms in Java and Python involves similar logic, but the syntax and built-in functions differ. For example, to find the maximum value in an array, Java requires a loop to iterate through the elements and compare each one. The following code demonstrates this process: `int max = arr[0]; for (int i = 1; i &lt; arr.length; i++) &#123; if (arr[i] &gt; max) &#123; max = arr[i]; &#125; &#125;`. This approach is explicit and requires managing loop variables and conditions.</p>
              <code className="code">int max = arr[0];<br />for (int i = 1; i &lt; arr.length; i++) &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;if (arr[i] &gt; max) &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;max = arr[i];<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#125;<br />&#125;</code>
              <p>In Python, built-in functions like `max` simplify this task. You can find the maximum value in a list with a single line of code: `max_value = max(arr)`. This built-in functionality enhances readability and reduces the amount of code needed to achieve the same result, making Python a more convenient choice for many algorithmic tasks.</p>
              <code className="code">max_value = max(arr)</code>
            </section>

            <section className="main-section" id="Inheritance">
              <header className="section-header">Inheritance</header>
              <p>Inheritance is a core principle of object-oriented programming, allowing classes to inherit properties and methods from a parent class. In Java, inheritance is achieved using the `extends` keyword. For example, a subclass `Labrador` that extends the `Dog` class would be defined as `public class Labrador extends Dog &#123; &#125;`. This approach enforces strict type hierarchies and helps maintain code organization.</p>
              <code className="code">public class Labrador extends Dog &#123;<br />&#125;</code>
              <p>Python uses a more straightforward syntax for inheritance, with the parent class listed in parentheses after the subclass name. For example, `class Labrador(Dog): pass` defines a subclass `Labrador` that inherits from the `Dog` class. This simplicity makes inheritance easy to implement and understand, although it may lack some of the explicit type safety features found in Java.</p>
              <code className="code">class Labrador(Dog):<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;pass</code>
            </section>

            <section className="main-section" id="Recursion">
              <header className="section-header">Recursion</header>
              <p>Recursion involves a function calling itself to solve a problem in smaller subproblems. In Java, recursion requires defining the base case and recursive case explicitly, as in the following example to calculate the factorial of a number: `public int factorial(int n) &#123; if (n &lt;= 1) &#123; return 1; &#125; else &#123; return n * factorial(n - 1); &#125; &#125;`. This clear separation of cases helps manage the flow of recursive calls.</p>
              <code className="code">public int factorial(int n) &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;if (n &lt;= 1) &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#125; else &#123;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return n * factorial(n - 1);<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#125;<br />&#125;</code>
              <p>In Python, recursion follows a similar structure but with less syntax. The same factorial function can be written as `def factorial(n): if n &lt;= 1: return 1 else: return n * factorial(n - 1)`. Python's clean and concise syntax makes recursive functions easy to write and understand, enhancing code readability and maintainability.</p>
              <code className="code">def factorial(n):<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;if n &lt;= 1:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;else:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return n * factorial(n - 1)</code>
