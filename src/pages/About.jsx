          <p>
            Founded in the summer of 2023 by a group of Hong Kong students, we
            hope to share some of our knowledge on various expertise and
            kickstart exchanges with others across the globe that enhances all
            of our understandings. Hence, our name is a portmanteau of the
            Chinese word "Kwan" (關), meaning care, with the word "Quantum", as
            quantum mechanics is the current best model for the fundamental
            truth of reality.{" "}

          <p>
            "If you want to master something, teach it." ~ Richard Feynman
            <br />
            <br />
            A dedicated and dynamic student-led initiative, the Kwantum
            Institute aims to teach others on various academic topics using
            forms of blogs to more serious planned series of articles. To us
            (Timothy especially), Richard Feynman serves as an inspiration for
            this sharing and exchanging of knowledge. Success is not merely
            about scientific breakthroughs, it is how the breakthrough is
            communicated to the general public so that the body of knowledge
            could be expanded.
            <br />
            <br />
            More importantly, we promote teaching and research as teaching is
            the best form of learning. The institute therefore yearns to
            encourage communities across different countries to explore our
            universe's secrets. Despite our Hongkonger origins and perhaps a tad
            leant towards STEM subjects, we consist of students from diverse
            backgrounds. We are thus unified by our unwavering interest in this
            encompassing knowledge across all disciplines that we so
            passionately explore.
            <br />
            <br />
            From a wide range of subjects such as quantum physics to computer
            science to philosophy to history (more science-y related ones), we
            have articles that tackle both theoretical and practical topics.
            Various writers among our team love applying scientific knowledge
            into creative engineering projects. On the other hand, some of our
            writers are interested on how science affects society and politics.
            And some other crazy maniacs just loves pure mathematics with
            seemingly no impact on society.
            <br />
            <br />
            This website will remain free and public forever because our members
            believe in the right to accessible information. We hope to give some
            alternative perspective and explanations of various educational
            topics, in particular that of sciences.

          <h1 className="text-3xl font-black">What We Do</h1>
          <p>
            As elaborated earlier, the institute is comprised of writers with a
            plethora of talents and interests. Initially, our website will
            primarily be themed around topics related to physical science,
            mathematics, and technology, but we plan on creating articles
            featuring topics from the biological and psychological sciences.
            <br />
            <br />
            Speaking of which, here are some ideas we are currently considering:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
            <li>
              Numerous technology articles- As you can see on the blog page,
              we're currently writing some articles on various subjects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Challenging homework/test/olympiad questions from maths and
              physics
            </li>
            <li>Databases for certain topics</li>
            <li>Coding tutorials/projects</li>
            <li>And more!</li>
          </ul>
